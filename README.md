- Detect pests and diseases: "Potato-Leaf-Disease-Classification-using-CNN"
Problem Statement :
Every year, farmers suffer economic losses and crop waste due to various diseases affecting potato plants. Among these diseases, Early Blight and Late Blight are particularly devastating to potato leaf health. The significant yield losses experienced by potato growers are largely attributed to these ailments. Consequently, images are categorized into three classes:
Potato Late Blight
Potato Early Blight
Potato Healthy Leaf

The process entails multiple steps, starting with the importation of libraries, loading and visualization of data, partitioning the data into training and validation sets, preprocessing the data, constructing the CNN model, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
